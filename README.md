# simple neural nets tutorial

This codebase and tutorial will guide you through the process of constructing neural networks from scratch, exclusively in numpy. In this tutorial, you will implement three fundamental architectures: feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional. 

This is an accompaniment to a larger project, [simple-neural-nets](github.com/sophiaas/simple-neural-nets), which contains pre-written pedagogical implementations of a variety of neural network architectures, all exclusively in numpy.

Walkthrough tutorial coming soon as of April 29th, 2020. For now, try your hand at completing the codebase yourself!

_I originally wrote this codebase while a graduate student instructor for UC Berkeley's Machine Learning course, CS189/289A. It was used as the 6th homework assignment in the spring 2020 semester. [sagnibak](https://github.com/sagnibak) is a contributor._
