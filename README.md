# simple neural nets tutorial

This codebase and tutorial will guide you through the process of constructing neural networks from scratch, exclusively in numpy. In this tutorial, you will implement three fundamental architectures: feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional. 

This is an accompaniment to a larger project, [simple-neural-nets](github.com/sophiaas/simple-neural-nets), which contains pre-written pedagogical implementations of a variety of neural network architectures, all exclusively in numpy.


_This codebase was originally written for UC Berkeley's Machine Learning class, CS189/289A. [sagnibak](https://github.com/sagnibak) is a contributor._
