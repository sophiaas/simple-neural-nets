# simple neural nets

This codebase provides the skeletal structure for implementing neural networks from scratch, exclusively in numpy. Fill in the blanks to implement three fundamental neural network architectures: feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional. 

I wrote this codebase while a Graduate Student Instructor for UC Berkeley's Machine Learning course, CS189/289A. It was used as the 6th homework assignment in the Spring 2020 semester. [sagnibak](https://github.com/sagnibak) is a contributor.
